Sequence: This is the default control structure,
 where statements are executed in the order they appear.

Selection: Selection structures allow the program to make decisions and execute
 different blocks of code based on certain conditions.
  The main selection structures in C++ are:

if statement: Executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
else statement: Specifies a block of code to be executed if 
the condition in the if statement is false.
else if statement: Specifies a new condition if the first condition is false.
switch statement: Evaluates an expression and executes code based on matching cases.

Iteration: Iteration structures, also known as loops, allow the program to 
repeat a block of code until a specified condition is met. 
The main iteration structures in C++ are:

for loop: Executes a block of code a specified number of times.
while loop: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
do...while loop: Executes a block of code once,
 and then repeats the loop as long as a specified condition is true./*
